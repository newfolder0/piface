Check only near recent face? - filter jumping between faces, etc.

Arduino boot interrupted if facestream already coming in - maybe only send when requested?
- HAVE to start arduino monitor THEN opencv code

Backup response if no faces or whatever (failsafe)

Don't use USB A-B cable, get a new one

pwm servo library

Test with lots of faces at once?
Test for long period
Test serial port consistency on Pi, maybe scan using some kind of handshake to be more robust.
